# Challenge: Design an interaction on Screen

## Overview
Create an interaction on screen with 5 state changes in a group of two. Made for Texas A&M's Human Computer Interaction Course Spring 24 (CSCE 436-500/200).

## Requirements
- Include 5+ state changes in sequence
  - Click a button and a feedback (e.g., loading an image) is one change
